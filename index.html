  <h1><u>Information :</u></h1>
  <p> Basketball is a team sport where two teams, usually consisting of five players on each team, play against each other on a rectangular court. The objective is to get the ball through a hoop mounted high on a backboard on the opponent's side of the court, while preventing the opponent from shooting it into your team's hoop. </p>
  <h1><u>Rules :</u></h1>
  <p>The aim of basketball is to score more points than the other team,
    by shooting the ball in the basket. Baskets can be worth 1, 2, or 3 points.
    You get points by "shooting" (throwing or dropping) the ball into the opponents' basket.
    The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.
    The ball is moved forward by, shooting passing (throwing or handing off) or dribbling it.
    The ball may not be carried by a player who is walking or running.</p>

    <h1><u>Information :</u></h1>
    <p> Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival.
       Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both.
       Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response. </p>
    <h1><u>Technique :</u></h1>
    <p>here are four main strokes used in competition and recreation swimming: the front crawl, also known as freestyle, the breaststroke, the backstroke and the butterfly.
      Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke.
      In 1873, John Arthur Trudgen introduced the trudgen to Western swimming competitions.
      The butterfly stroke developed in the 1930s, and was considered a variant of the breaststroke until accepted as a separate style in 1953.
      Butterfly is considered the hardest stroke by many people, but it is the most effective for all-around toning and the building of muscles.
      It also burns the most calories.</p>

    <h1><u>Information :</u></h1>
    <p> Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court. </p>
    <h1><u>Rules :</u></h1>
    <p>A match consists of the best of 3 games of 21 points.
       Every time there is a serve – there is a point scored.
       The side winning a rally adds a point to its score.
       At 20 all, the side which gains a 2 point lead first, wins that game.
       At 29 all, the side scoring the 30th point, wins that game.</p>

    <h1><u>Information :</u></h1>
    <p> Table tennis, also known as ping-pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small rackets.
      The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net.
    Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926.
    ITTF currently includes 226 member associations.Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.</p>
    <h1><u>Rules :</u></h1>
    <p>Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once.
       A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules.
       Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.</p>
